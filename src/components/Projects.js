          An example E-commerce Website. It consumes an example API from the Fake Store API, takes the data and displays it in
          a functional React App which uses React-Router-Dom and dynamic client-side routing. I increased my confidence using
          React-Router-Dom, asynchronous JavaScript in React and how the unidirectional ï¬‚ow of data works.

          A single player Battleship game against a computer.I created this app to learn TDD and in particular unit testing. I built it
          using JavaScript, Jest, HTML, Scss/Sass, NPM, Webpack, Babel and ESLint. I was able to further my knowledge of TDD,
          unit testing and Scss/Sass by doing this.

          asynchronous JavaScript, the JavaScript event loop, APIs and JSON data.
