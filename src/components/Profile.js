          I am a self taught developer looking for an opportunity to learn and grow by working within
          an experienced team.

        I first became interested in programing by learning to use Python for investment analysis and quickly found it very
        enjoyable learning fundamental programing concepts and building simple applications. This eventually led me to the
        decision to pursue software development as a career. I began learning through the paradigm of web development in May
        2021 and I am now completely certain this is what I want as my vocation. To continue improving in this discipline I want to
        work in a team with people who are more experienced than me whom I can learn from.
